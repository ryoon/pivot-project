Title:
Introducing Apache Pivot

Abstract:
Apache Pivot (http://pivot.apache.org) is a platform for building rich Internet applications (RIAs) in Java. It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features of a modern RIA toolkit with the robustness of the industry-standard Java platform. Pivot includes a number of features that significantly simplify development of modern GUI applications, including an XML markup language for declaring the structure of a user interface, data binding, animated effects and transitions, and Web services integration.

In this session, Pivot founders Greg Brown and Todd Volkert provide an overview of the Pivot platform and walk through the implementation of a simple but practical application that highlights key platform features and development best practices.
