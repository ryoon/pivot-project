Title:
Introducing Apache Pivot

Abstract:
Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building rich Internet applications in Java (or any other JVM scripting language). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features of a modern RIA toolkit with the robustness of the Java platform. Pivot includes a number of features that significantly simplify development of modern GUI applications, including an XML markup language for declaring the structure of a user interface, style support, data binding, animated effects, and Web services integration.

Pivot founder Greg Brown will provide an overview of the Pivot platform and walk through the implementation of a simple but practical application, first in Java and then in other JVM languages including JavaScript, Groovy, and Scala.
